			During her time in college, she maintained a part time job working for a software development company that specialized in higher education health science software solutions. Throughout her two year internship, she established professional skills working on project implementations, databases, and client relationship management. As an intern, she planned, implemented, and successfully executed the company's first  3-day conference hosted in Kansas City. She also shifted the company's training efforts from written help manuals to short tutorial videos which she edited, managed, and later implemented into the systems. As a project manager, she worked closely with the development team to deliver and implement client projects in a timely and efficient manner. 
			<br></br> 
			In her free time, Megan has taken an interest in web design. She has created various professional websites including an online portfolio showcasing her skills, work experience, and recent projects. To learn more, please visit http://www.MeganEBarrera.com/. One of her most prominent projects is her family's organization Team AROCK. Team AROCK is an organization dedicated to fundraising for JDRF (Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation) in loving memory of her cousin, Aaron Barrera. Megan manages the organization's website, photos, and videos. If you would like to get in touch, she can be contacted directly at megan.barrera1@gmail.com.</p>
